# Backend API for Recipe Generation App

This repository contains the backend API for a Recipe Generation application built with Python and Flask. The app leverages OpenAI's GPT technology to generate personalized recipes based on available ingredients. The backend handles user authentication with JWT and bcrypt, ensuring secure login and account management.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and bcrypt for password hashing.
- **Recipe Generation**: Generate personalized recipes based on ingredients input by the user using OpenAI's API.
- **Secure API**: All endpoints are protected by JWT authentication to ensure only authorized users can access them.
- **Data Handling**: Input validation, error handling, and response formatting to provide a smooth user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Backend language.
- **Flask**: Web framework for building the API.
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for secure user authentication.
- **bcrypt**: For hashing passwords securely.
- **OpenAI**: To generate recipe suggestions based on user inputs.
- **SQLAlchemy**: (If applicable, mention the ORM or database used).
